## Start a new feature:
1. Create a new feature branch based on the latest `develop` branch.
2. Implement the new feature, committing your changes to the feature branch.
3. Once the feature is complete, submit a pull request to merge the feature branch into the `develop` branch.

## Prepare for a release:
1. Create a new release branch based on the latest `develop` branch.
2. Perform necessary release-specific tasks such as version number updates or documentation changes.
3. Test the release branch to ensure it is stable and ready for deployment.
4. Once ready, submit a pull request to merge the release branch into both `master` and `develop` branches.

## Hotfix a production issue:
1. Create a new hotfix branch based on the `master` branch.
2. Fix the critical issue in the hotfix branch, committing your changes.
3. Test the hotfix to ensure it resolves the issue.
4. Once tested, submit a pull request to merge the hotfix branch into both `master` and `develop` branches.

## Maintain and merge branches:
- Regularly merge changes from the `develop` branch into your feature branches to keep them up to date.
- Periodically merge changes from the `develop` branch into the `release` branch to include the latest features and fixes.
- Once a release is complete, merge the `release` branch into `master` to update the production version.
